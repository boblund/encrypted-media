      <p>Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the discussions are likely to find the specification changing out from under them in incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage should join the mailing list mentioned below and take part in the discussions.</p>

    <section id="stream-format">
      <h2>Stream Format</h2>
      <p>Under the ISO Common Encryption ('cenc') protection scheme [[!CENC-1ST]], ISO Base media File Format [[!BMFF]] content is encrypted at the sample level with AES-128 CTR encryption. This protection method enables multiple Key Systems to decrypt the same media content.</p>
      <p>Each key is identified by a <a def-id="key-id"></a> and each encrypted sample is associated with the Key ID of the key needed to decrypt it. This association is signaled either through the specification of a default Key ID in the track encryption box ('tenc') or by assigning the sample to a Sample Group, the definition of which specifies a Key ID. Common encryption files may contain a mixture of encrypted and unencrypted samples.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="detect-encrypt">
      <h2>Detecting Encryption</h2>
      <p>Protection scheme signaling conforms with ISO Base media File Format [[!BMFF]]. When protection has been applied, the stream type will be transformed to 'encv' for video or 'enca' for audio, with a Protection Scheme Information Box ('sinf') added to the sample entry in the Sample Description Box ('stsd'). The Protection Scheme Information Box ('sinf') will contain a Scheme Type Box ('schm') with a scheme_type field set to a value of 'cenc' (Common Encryption).</p>
      <p>The "encrypted block" is a sample. Determining whether a sample is encrypted depends on the corresponding Track Encryption Box ('tenc') and the sample group with grouping type 'seig' (CencSampleEncryption group), if any, associated with the sample.
      The default encryption state of a sample is defined by the IsEncrypted flag in the associated track encryption box ('tenc'). This default state may be modified by the IsEncrypted flag in the SampleGroupDescriptionBox ('sgpd'), pointed to by an index in the SampleToGroupBox ('sbgp').</p>
      <p>Samples can be partially encrypted, specified by subsample information referenced by SampleAuxiliaryInformationSizesBox ('saiz') and SampleAuxiliaryInformationOffsetsBox ('saio') boxes.</p>
      <p>For complete information, see [[!CENC-1ST]].</p>
    </section>

    <section id="init-data">
      <h2>Initialization Data</h2>
      <p>Base Media File Format Common Encryption files may contain one or more protection system specific header ('pssh') boxes, each for a unique SystemID at each location where a 'pssh' box is necessary. </p>
      <p><a def-id="initialization-data"></a> MUST be created from 'pssh' boxes as defined in [[CENC-INIT]]. <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> MUST be created from multiple 'pssh' boxes if and only if they appear directly next to each other in the file.</p>
